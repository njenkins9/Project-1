      <h3>DAILY SCHEDULE: INTERPRETIVE TALKS & FEEDINGS</h3>

      <p>The Greater Vancouver Zoo offers a wide variety of interesting, fun and educational interpretive talks & animal feedings that you can enjoy.

Effective October 1st we are in our Off Season and we offer our Meet a Reptile talks on weekends only at 11 am.
Other Interpretive Talks will begin back in our Peak Season.
Upon arrival please check our Welcome Board for a list of all daily activities and/or presentations.
We are open year round (except Christmas Day) and each season offers something completely different.

** Please keep in mind that on some days our animal friends might not feel like cooperating like you want them to. Since they are volunteers, our schedule and theirs might change - we hope you understand that all of the presentations are subject to change. Also some shows are weather dependent.
